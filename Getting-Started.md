# Getting Started with WFM

## Overview
A Field Workforce Management (WFM) application connects a business' back-office with its fleet of mobilized employees.  FeedHenry WFM leverages commoditized mobile hardware, making use of each employee's mobile phone.

## WFM Structure
WFM 2 consists of a set of reusable modules. A demo application is provided that showcases how these modules can be assembled into an application.

### WFM Modules
WFM modules are packaged and distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).  They are best included in your application using [browserify](http://browserify.org/).  WFM modules will export one or more of:

* Angular.js directives or services providing client-side functionality for both the mobile and portal clients.
* Express.js routes providing a REST API to be consumed by the client-side portions of the module.
* FeedHenry sync configurations for seamlessly enabling data synchronization of a module's data.

Refer to the READMEs of the respective modules for details on their purpose and consumption.

#### Loose Coupling
WFM modules make use of the [mediator pattern](https://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/) to enable loose coupling between the WFM modules and their consuming applications.  Refer to the WFM mediator README for usage instructions and API details.

### WFM Demo Apps
The demo applications run on Red Hat Mobile Application Platform (RHMAP).  The demo project consists of:

* **wfm-portal**: a sample back-office application.
This is where work is collected and pushed to the workers out in the field.
* **wfm-mobile**: is the mobile application running on the field workers' mobile devices.
* **wfm-cloud**: the cloud application provides the gateway into the FeedHenry MBaaS.
* **wfm-auth**: an MBaaS service that integrates with the FeedHenry authentication system.

## Running the WFM Demo Apps
RHMAP provides a set of WFM project templates to help you get the WFM demo apps up and running.

### Create and Configure the WFM Demo Project Using the Project Templates

  9. Click **Push Environment Variables**.


7. Finally, check that the auth service, the cloud app, and the portal app are all deployed and started.
  1. For each of the above mentioned apps, select **Deploy** from the left-hand side menu.
